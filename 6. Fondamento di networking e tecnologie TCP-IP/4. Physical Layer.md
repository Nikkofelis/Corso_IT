## Characteristics

### Bandwidth

Measured in kilobits per seconds (kbps). It is the capacity of a medium to carry data per time unit.

#### Terminology

```ad-abstract
title: Throughput

The measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time across a media. Usually lower than bandwidth.
```

```ad-abstract
title: Goodput

The measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time. It's like the throughput without the overhead. Usually lower than throughput.
```
