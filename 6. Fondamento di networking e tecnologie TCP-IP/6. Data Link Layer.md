Is responsible for network interface card (NIC) to network interface card communications. Is the last ==hardware dependent== layer.

The data link field is the ==frame==. The overhead is greater for wireless connections.

Divided into sublayers:

- **Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer**: It places information in the frame. It labels the data. It is usually the NIC driver.
- **Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer**: It is responsible for ==data encapsulation== and media ==access control==.
	- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3): cable link
	- WLAN (IEEE 802.11): wireless communications
	- WPAN (IEEE 802.15): bluetooth, RFID, etc.

During the transmission, the Frame (the header and the trailer, NOT the internal Package) changes based on the physical media used.

## Topologies

- LAN
	- **Star**: full duplex
	- **Extended Star**: full duplex
	- **Bus**: half duplex
	- **Ring**: token

```ad-note
title: Half Duplex

Double senses communication, non simultaneous.

```ad-note

Double sense communication and simultaneous.

### Access Control Network

- **Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CD**: it detects collisions through difference of tension
	- Legacy bus topology: Uses collision detection (CD)
	- Legacy ethernet hub: Uses collision detection (CD)
- **Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CA**: the end devices sends also a RTS (ready-to-send) along with the frame to request the network usage, the access point (if the network is free) sends back a CTS (Clear-to-send) signal
	- **WLAN**: uses CSMA/CA
