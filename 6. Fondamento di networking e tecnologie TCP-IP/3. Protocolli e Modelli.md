title: Protocols

Rules that defines how devices communicates.
```

Protocol Examples:

- HTTP: Controls how web client and web server interacts
- TCP: Guaranties the information are delivered
- IP: Delivering messages from sender to receiver
- DNS: Assigns an IP to a site name
- DHCP: Automatically assigns an IP to a device

Overhead: Codice di comunicazione, parte del messaggio usato solo a contenere le informazioni per inviare il messaggio. Da distinguere dal contenuto del messaggio.

# Network Protocol Functions

| Function                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Addressing**            | This ==identifies the sender and the intended receiver== of the message using a defined addressing scheme. Examples of protocols that provide addressing include Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6.                                                                                          |
| **Reliability**           | This function provides ==guaranteed delivery== mechanisms in case messages are lost or corrupted in transit. TCP provides guaranteed delivery.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Flow control**          | This function ==ensures that data flows at an efficient rate== between two communicating devices. TCP provides flow control services.                                                                                                                                               | 
| **Sequencing**            | This function uniquely ==labels each transmitted segment of data==. The receiving device uses the sequencing information to reassemble the information correctly. This is useful if the data segments are lost, delayed or received out-of-order. TCP provides sequencing services. |
| **Error Detection**       | This function is used to ==determine if data became corrupted during transmission==. Various protocols that provide error detection include Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, and TCP.                                                                                                          |
| **Application Interface** | This function contains ==information used for process-to-process communications== between network applications. For example, when accessing a web page, HTTP or HTTPS protocols are used to communicate between the client and server web processes.                                |

```ad-abstract
A protocol suite is a group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function. Like TCP/IP or OSI.

# Protocol Stack Table

The advantages of using a layered model are:

- Assist in protocol design
- Foster competition between vendors
- Prevents a layer to affect another one
- Common language to describe network functionality
- Helps in visualisation of interaction between layers

# Data Encapsulation

It moves DOWN on the [Protocol Stack Table](#Protocol%20Stack%20Table).

- **Segmentation**: process of dividing a stream of data into smaller units for transmissions over the network.
- **Multiplexing**: Segmentation done by multiple devices simultaneously.
- **Sequencing**: Labelling of data segments for reassembling.
